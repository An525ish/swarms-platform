This document is NOT an arbitrary set of rules to be followed blindly, but rather a written down of the agreed upon standard. Of course this is a living document and subject to change, so feel free to submit pull requests to this document as well.

These rules only purpose is to improve code readability and quality and thus maintainability and overall project success. Whenever a rule is in conflict with this goal it should be challenged.

## What do I need to know to contribute? ü§ùüë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

Never made an open source contribution before? And wondering how to contribute to this project? üòï No worries! Here's what you need.

### Installation

1. Fork the repo, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

   ```sh
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/swarms-platform
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd swarms-platform
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from origin `main`:

   ```sh
   git checkout <main-branch>
   git pull origin <main-branch>
   ```

3. Create a new branch (off the main project branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
   ```

4. Install the dependencies üì¶
   > As Swarms Platform uses an npm package manager, it is believed you've a node stable version installed, [install node][https://nodejs.org/en/download]
   
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

5. Make .env.local file in root directory with these variables üìÅ
   > This step is NOT optional, Add this step if you want to run the complete web application in your terminal

    ```
    SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID= 'YOUR GITHUB CLIENT ID STRING GOES HERE'
    SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GITHUB_SECRET= 'YOUR GITHUB CLIENT ID STRING GOES HERE'
    ```

    <!-- These environment variables are used for Supabase Local Dev -->
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=


**IMPORTANT** to note that you cannot get the project running without the two env values setup here. 
   
### Setting up Github OAuth - (Client ID and Client Secrets)

To setup your github client id and secret, we recommend going through the steps in the [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app).

**Note** that for the "Authorization callback URL", this is gotten from the database setup "https://<supabase_name>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback", in this case, the database the project works with is Supabase.

The Github client id and secret also plays a role as they are included as values if Github is setup as a provider in Supabase Authentication column.

### Setting up Supabase

Just has been mentioned, [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is the go to database for the project. If you are not familiar with supabase, do not worry, it is easy to setup.




### Using the issue tracker

The repository [issue](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms-platform/issues) page is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs),
[features requests](#features) and [submitting pull
requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

- Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) or AI models specifically for help including [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Blackbox](https://www.blackbox.ai/)).

- Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

### Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful‚Äîthank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** ‚Äî check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** ‚Äî try to reproduce it using the latest `main` or `dev` branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** ‚Äî create a [reduced test case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.

‚ÄúPrograms are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute.‚Äù ‚Äî Harold Abelson

A good bug report shouldn‚Äôt leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. 
> 1. What is your environment? 
> 2. What steps will reproduce the issue? 
> 3. What browser(s) and OS experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? 
All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. 
> This might include the lines of code that you have identified as causing the bug, 
> and potential solutions (and your opinions on their merits).

### Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It‚Äôs up to _you_ to make a strong case to convince the project‚Äôs developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

### Pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, e.t.c), it's important to discuss the changes with the repository owners through our channels on [discord](https://discord.com/channels/999382051935506503/999387347978301551).

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as file structure).
